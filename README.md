# Karen’s Portfolio Project 📸✨

Welcome to **Karen’s Portfolio Project** — the most important website on the internet right now (don’t fact-check us, just roll with it).

This repo exists to build a professional, elegant, and downright gorgeous photography portfolio site for **Karen**. Yes, *that* Karen. But unlike the meme version of a “Karen,” this one isn’t here to ask for the manager — she’s here to capture life’s best moments through the lens.

## Project Plan 🚀
1. Build a **base website** in the `main` branch with all the essentials: home, galleries, about, and contact.
2. Create **theme branches** (e.g., `theme/minimal-grid`, `theme/fullscreen`, `theme/editorial`) where we experiment with different layouts and styles.
3. Use **preview deployments** for each branch to share visual options.
4. Merge the chosen theme back into `main` — archiving the others like outdated haircuts.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Static HTML/CSS/JS** (lightweight & reliable)
- **Minimal CSS framework** for rapid styling
- **Lightbox gallery** for smooth, interactive viewing
- **GitHub Pages / Netlify hosting** for previews and deployment

---

## Goals 🎯
- Present Karen’s photography in a clean, professional way.
- Keep navigation simple and intuitive for visitors.
- Provide an engaging gallery experience without heavy code bloat.
- Include a direct contact option for bookings.
- Bonus: lift spirits with a few inside jokes along the way.

## Contribution Notes
- Branch responsibly — theme previews live on their own branches.
- If you break the build, you *will* have to talk to the manager (spoiler: it’s Karen).
- Screenshots and preview URLs should be included in branch READMEs.

This isn’t just a website.  
It’s Karen’s digital stage — where her work gets the spotlight it deserves.  
And unlike the meme, this Karen isn’t here to complain… she’s here to capture.
